This project explores Wikipedia as a unique form of social media that thrives without conventional mechanisms of online validation such as likes, follower counts, or karma. Despite its minimalist interface and lack of gamified features, Wikipedia has sustained one of the largest and most productive online communities in history. This study investigates how collaboration, conflict, and governance function within this nontraditional platform. Using data from the Wikipedia API—such as revision histories, talk page interactions, and pageview statistics—we analyze how contributors engage, self-regulate, and maintain information quality. By comparing these patterns with social platforms like Reddit and Twitter, we identify how Wikipedia’s open, transparent, and accountability-driven design fosters participation without the toxicity often associated with algorithmic engagement. Ultimately, the paper argues that Wikipedia’s governance model offers valuable lessons for designing healthier digital spaces that balance openness, trust, and collective responsibility.
