Wikipedia demonstrates that large-scale online collaboration can thrive without traditional social media mechanics. Its model of open participation, transparent governance, and intrinsic motivation enables sustained engagement and collective intelligence. By examining how Wikipedia self-regulates conflict and ensures quality, this paper highlights the potential for designing online platforms that foster cooperation over competition. Future work will expand the dataset, include network-level analyses of editor interactions, and explore how specific governance tools—like administrator actions or arbitration pages—affect long-term community health.
