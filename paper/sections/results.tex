Preliminary analysis of our 30-day dataset shows consistent participation across Wikipedia topics despite the absence of algorithmic promotion or social feedback. Articles such as \textit{Artificial intelligence} and \textit{Climate change} exhibited the highest average daily pageviews, confirming ongoing, distributed engagement rather than short-lived viral spikes.

Revision logs indicate bursty editing patterns that often correspond to news events, suggesting that editors are motivated by relevance and collective responsiveness rather than personal gain. Talk page data further reveal a balance between conflict and resolution: even contentious debates eventually lead to consensus-building, reflecting Wikipediaâ€™s strong governance norms.
