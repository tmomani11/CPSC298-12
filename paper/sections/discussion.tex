These results reinforce the idea that collaboration on Wikipedia depends on social trust and transparent processes rather than gamified incentives. Editors appear to be motivated by shared purpose and accountability rather than visibility or personal reward. This distinguishes Wikipedia from mainstream social media, where algorithms amplify polarization and competition.

The persistence of editor engagement despite the lack of “likes” suggests that meaningful participation can emerge from well-structured governance rather than from dopamine-driven mechanics. Transparency—through open edit histories and talk pages—acts as both accountability and reputation system. These insights could inform the design of alternative platforms that prioritize collaboration and trust over engagement metrics.
