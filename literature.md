[pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1107.3689)  

**Summary:** Presents a method for detecting severe conflicts (“edit wars”) across multiple language Wikipedias. Analyzes deviations in edit & revert patterns, discussion lengths, and burstiness.  
**Relevance:** Directly ties to research on conflict dynamics, collaboration, and how Wikipedia handles contention without “likes” or reputation metrics.

## 2. Temporal Features of Conflict
**Yasseri, T., Sumi, R., Rung, A., Kornai, J., & Kertész, J. (2012).**  
*Dynamics of Conflicts in Wikipedia.*  
[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Dynamics+of+Conflicts+in+Wikipedia+Yasseri)  
[pdf](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3380063/)  

**Summary:** Investigates temporal features of editorial conflict (burstiness, memory effects) by comparing controversial and peaceful articles.  
**Relevance:** Helps distinguish collaboration patterns in contested vs. non-contested pages, highlighting governance mechanisms.

## 3. Game Theory of Collaboration
**Anand, S., Arazy, O., Mandayam, N., & Nov, O. (2014).**  
*A Game Theoretic Analysis of Collaboration in Wikipedia.*  
[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=A+Game+Theoretic+Analysis+of+Collaboration+in+Wikipedia)  
[pdf](https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0794)  

**Summary:** Models contributors’ decisions as a noncooperative game, where contributor utility is based on content ownership vs. editing costs. Empirically tests predictions using Wikipedia data.  
**Relevance:** Provides a theoretical lens on competition vs. collaboration in Wikipedia, relevant to questions of motivation without karma or likes.



## 4. Sustainability of Online Collaboration
**Israeli, A., Jurgens, D., & Romero, D. (2024).**  
*A Test of Time: Predicting the Sustainable Success of Online Collaboration in Wikipedia.*  
[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=A+Test+of+Time+Predicting+the+Sustainable+Success+of+Online+Collaboration+in+Wikipedia)  
[pdf](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19150)  

**Summary:** Proposes a metric called “Sustainable Success” to measure how well Wikipedia articles maintain quality over time, using edit history, contributor experience, and team structure.  
**Relevance:** Helps study long-term participation and article quality — directly connected to your question about sustaining collaboration without likes.

## 5. Bots and Social Dynamics
**Geiger, R. S., & Halfaker, A. (2018).**  
*Operationalizing Conflict and Cooperation between Automated Software Agents in Wikipedia: A Replication and Expansion of “Even Good Bots Fight”.*  
[Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Operationalizing+Conflict+and+Cooperation+between+Automated+Software+Agents+in+Wikipedia)  
[pdf](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.07273)  

**Summary:** Examines conflict and cooperation between bots editing Wikipedia. Challenges earlier claims of bot–bot conflict by combining quantitative metrics with ethnographic methods.  
**Relevance:** Adds the dimension of algorithmic participation to social dynamics, broadening analysis of governance and trust.
